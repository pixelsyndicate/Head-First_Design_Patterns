Compile the files at the command prompt:
csc /noconfig /t:library RemotableType.cs
csc /noconfig /r:RemotableType.dll Listener.cs
csc /noconfig /r:RemotableType.dll Client.cs

To run the application:
-Create a subdirectory called Client. 
-Copy the RemotableType.dll, Client.exe, and Client.exe.config 
files to the Client directory. 
-At the command prompt in the Listener directory, type: Listener 

-When the Listener application is running, open a new 
command prompt in the Client directory and type: Client 

Changing the Channel
-Because the Listener.exe.config and Client.exe.config files 
contain all the configuration information necessary to make a 
remote connection, you can change the channel without recompiling 
your application merely by changing the channel specified in the 
configuration file.

To change the channel to a TcpChannel object, which uses binary 
serialization by default, you merely change the <wellknown> element 
in the Client.exe.config file to the following:

<wellknown 
   type="RemotableType, RemotableType"
   url="tcp://localhost:8989/RemotableType.rem"
/>
You must also change the <channel> element in the Listener.exe.config 
file to the following:

<channel ref="tcp" port="8989"/>
Rerun the application according to the preceding execution instructions. 
You do not need to recompile the application.
